### shock & trend
> This project works on recognizing oscillation or tendency during the changing stocks prices. It helps the stocker manager to decide when to sale or buy in stocks market.

Burg algorithm is applied here to derive the PSD according to normalized frequency.High PSD means that it is a high possibility of that the stock changing frequency is in that accurate frequency. This method is verified with different stocks in variable time scale (day line or minute line). 
Trade points are classified with defined rules which are realized in _'wave_divide.ipynb'_. And the prediction by Burg method in different way is showed in _'methodCompare.ipynb'_. Accuracy of this method is calculated in _'accuracyCheck.py'_ ,and the final result is __70%__ based on the tagged trade-points in _'wave_divide.ipynb'_. In the picture of 'rightDividedPoints.png', we can see the predicted shock points are catenated like a wave.
